# .pylintrc
# Configuration file for Pylint, designed for incremental improvement.

[MAIN]
# Specify the number of parallel jobs to run, 0 means use all available cores.
# Useful for larger projects.
# jobs=0

# Automatically load extensions specified in the 'load-plugins' option.
load-plugins=

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# Disable specific messages.
# Start by disabling noisy checks (docstrings, complexity, some style conventions)
# and focus on errors and critical warnings first.
# Re-enable these checks gradually as the code improves.
disable=
    # --- Docstring Related ---
    C0114, # missing-module-docstring
    C0115, # missing-class-docstring
    C0116, # missing-function-docstring

    # --- Refactoring / Complexity Related ---
    R0902, # too-many-instance-attributes (Not in current output, but often disabled initially)
    R0903, # too-few-public-methods (Not in current output, but often disabled initially)
    R0912, # too-many-branches
    R0913, # too-many-arguments
    R0914, # too-many-locals
    R0915, # too-many-statements
    R0917, # too-many-positional-arguments
    R1705, # no-else-return
    R1716, # chained-comparison
    R1720, # no-else-raise
    R1723, # no-else-break
    R0801, # duplicate-code (Useful, but disable initially to reduce noise)

    # --- Naming Conventions ---
    C0103, # invalid-name (Often needs configuration or relaxation initially)

    # --- Other Warnings/Conventions ---
    W0212, # protected-access (Often acceptable, especially in tests)
    # W0621, # redefined-outer-name (Only appeared once, consider keeping enabled unless it becomes noisy)
    # W1309, # f-string-without-interpolation (Minor, keep enabled for now)
    # C0325, # superfluous-parens (Minor, keep enabled for now)


# Enable specific messages. You usually don't need this unless you disable
# broad categories and want specific ones back.
# enable=

[FORMAT]
# Increase the maximum number of characters allowed on a single line.
# Default is 100. 120 is a common modern alternative.
max-line-length=120

# Regexp for acceptable indentation units (e.g. normal tabs, normal spaces).
indent-string='    ' # Use 4 spaces (default)

# Allow trailing comma if wanted (often used with auto-formatters like black)
accept-no-trailing-comma=no

[DESIGN]
# Even though complexity checks (R09*) are disabled above,
# you could relax the limits here instead if you re-enable them later.
 max-args=7
 max-locals=20
 max-statements=60
 max-branches=15
 max-attributes=10

[VARIABLES]
# List of variable names allowed to be redefined in loops.
# dummy-variables-rgx=^_|dummy

# List of names allowed for unused variables. Helps ignore intentional unused args.
# ignored-argument-names=args,kwargs,_.*

[TYPECHECK]
# List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked.
# Use this if Pylint incorrectly reports errors for valid members of certain libraries.
# ignored-modules=

# Tell pylint whether to check classmember attributes in files that do not contain the class definition.
# Confidence has to be HIGH to report an error.
confidence=HIGH

[REPORTS]

[SIMILARITIES]
# Minimum lines number of a similarity.

# Ignore comments when computing similarities.

# Ignore docstrings when computing similarities.
